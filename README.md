# Bank of Maldives - Payment gateway integration reference

This is for your reference if you are attempting to integrate your website with BML payment gateway.

Before we begin, make sure you have [docker](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-docker-on-ubuntu-16-04) and [docker-compose](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-docker-compose-on-ubuntu-16-04) setup on your host machine. You will also need [php composer](https://hub.docker.com/r/library/composer) (scroll down to the bottom where it explains a simple way to get php composer working by adding a short snippet to your ~/.bashrc or ~/zshrc).

Finally, clone this repository and run the following commands within the root directory.

> composer install

> docker-compose up

Hey presto! Now you have a working e-commerce website. Give it a go at http://localhost:8036
